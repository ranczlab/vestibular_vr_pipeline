    "======================================\n",
    "\n",
    "1. bout_window (1.5 seconds)\n",
    "   - Purpose: Groups saccades that occur within this time window into \"bouts\"\n",
    "   - How it works: If two saccades occur within 1.5s of each other, they're grouped into the same bout\n",
    "   - Reasoning: Compensatory saccades occur in rapid succession during head rotation\n",
    "   - Typical values: 1.0-2.0 seconds (adjust based on your data)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. pre_saccade_window (0.3 seconds)\n",
    "   - Purpose: Time window BEFORE each saccade onset to analyze for drift/stability\n",
    "   - How it works: Measures mean velocity and position drift in the 0.3s before saccade starts\n",
    "     * IMPORTANT: The window is constrained to not extend before the peak time of the previous saccade\n",
    "     * This ensures we only measure the inter-saccade interval, not the period during the previous saccade\n",
    "   - Reasoning: \n",
    "     * Compensatory: Eye drifts slowly before saccade (compensating for head rotation)\n",
    "     * Orienting: Eye is stable before saccade (at rest before quick shift)\n",
    "   - Typical values: 0.2-0.5 seconds (should capture pre-saccade behavior)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. max_intersaccade_interval_for_classification (5.0 seconds)\n",
    "   - Purpose: Maximum time to extend post-saccade window until the next saccade occurs\n",
    "   - How it works: \n",
    "     * For each saccade, the post-saccade window dynamically extends until the next saccade starts\n",
    "     * If the next saccade occurs within max_intersaccade_interval_for_classification, use that interval\n",
    "     * If no next saccade occurs within this time, cap at max_intersaccade_interval_for_classification\n",
    "     * Measures position change/variance in this dynamic window\n",
    "   - Reasoning:\n",
    "     * Compensatory saccades: Eye position continues to change until next compensatory saccade (large position change)\n",
    "     * Orienting saccades: Eye settles at new position and stays stable (small position change)\n",
    "   - Typical values: 3-10 seconds (should capture behavior until next saccade or reasonable maximum)\n",
    "   - This parameter is key for distinguishing compensatory vs orienting based on eye position stability\n",
    "\n",
    "5. pre_saccade_velocity_threshold (50.0 px/s)\n",
    "   - Purpose: Threshold for mean absolute velocity in pre-saccade window\n",
    "   - How it works: If mean(|velocity|) > threshold → evidence of drift (compensatory)\n",
    "   - Reasoning: Compensatory saccades follow slow drift (velocity > 0)\n",
    "   - Typical values: 30-100 px/s (adjust based on your sampling rate and noise level)\n",
    "   - Too low: May misclassify orienting saccades with noise as compensatory\n",
    "   - Too high: May miss true compensatory drift\n",
    "\n",
    "6. pre_saccade_drift_threshold (10.0 px)\n",
    "   - Purpose: Threshold for position change in pre-saccade window\n",
    "   - How it works: If |position_end - position_start| > threshold → evidence of drift (compensatory)\n",
    "   - Reasoning: Compensatory saccades follow slow position drift (eye moves slowly)\n",
    "   - Typical values: 5-20 px (adjust based on your typical saccade amplitudes)\n",
    "   - Too low: May misclassify orienting saccades with small movements as compensatory\n",
    "   - Too high: May miss true compensatory drift\n",
    "\n",
    "7. post_saccade_variance_threshold (100.0 px²)\n",
    "   - Purpose: Threshold for position variance in post-saccade window\n",
    "   - How it works: If variance < threshold → stable position (orienting)\n",
    "   - Reasoning: Orienting saccades settle at new stable position (low variance)\n",
    "   - Typical values: 50-200 px² (adjust based on your noise level)\n",
    "   - Too low: May misclassify orienting saccades as compensatory\n",
    "   - Too high: May misclassify compensatory saccades as orienting\n",
    "   - Note: Less reliable for saccades in bouts (next saccade may occur soon after)\n",
    "\n",
    "8. post_saccade_position_change_threshold_percent (50.0%)\n",
    "   - Purpose: Threshold for position change in dynamic post-saccade window, expressed as percentage of saccade amplitude\n",
    "   - How it works: \n",
    "     * Calculates total position change from end of saccade until next saccade (or max interval)\n",
    "     * Compares to saccade amplitude: if post_change > amplitude * threshold_percent → compensatory\n",
    "     * Compensatory saccades: Eye continues moving after saccade (large position change relative to amplitude)\n",
    "     * Orienting saccades: Eye settles at new position (small position change relative to amplitude)\n",
    "   - Reasoning: \n",
    "     * Compensatory: Eye position continues changing until next compensatory saccade (change comparable to or larger than saccade amplitude)\n",
    "     * Orienting: Eye settles and stays stable (change much smaller than saccade amplitude)\n",
    "   - Typical values: 30-70% (adjust based on your data)\n",
    "   - Too low: May misclassify orienting saccades with small noise as compensatory\n",
    "   - Too high: May miss true compensatory drift patterns\n",
    "   - Key advantage: Relative to amplitude, so adapts to different saccade sizes\n",

    "PRACTICAL TUNING GUIDE (For QC Adjustments):\n",
    "=============================================\n",
    "When you find a miscategorized saccade during QC, here's what to adjust:\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ PROBLEM: Two orienting saccades close together are misclassified as compensatory\n",
    "   → SOLUTION: Decrease bout_window (e.g., 1.5 → 1.0 seconds)\n",
    "   → WHY: Makes the classifier less likely to group saccades into bouts\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ PROBLEM: Compensatory saccades misclassified as orienting (happens in bouts)\n",
    "   → SOLUTION: Increase bout_window (e.g., 1.5 → 2.0 seconds)\n",
    "   → WHY: Better captures rapid compensatory saccade sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ PROBLEM: Compensatory saccades misclassified as orienting (isolated saccades)\n",
    "   → SOLUTION: Decrease pre_saccade_velocity_threshold or pre_saccade_drift_threshold\n",
    "   → WHY: Makes it easier to detect slow pre-saccade drift that indicates compensation\n",
    "   → OR: Increase post_saccade_position_change_threshold_percent (e.g., 50 → 70)\n",
    "   → WHY: Requires larger post-saccade position change to classify as compensatory\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ PROBLEM: Orienting saccades misclassified as compensatory (too sensitive to drift)\n",
    "   → SOLUTION: Increase pre_saccade_velocity_threshold or pre_saccade_drift_threshold\n",
    "   → WHY: Requires stronger evidence of drift before classifying as compensatory\n",
    "   → OR: Decrease post_saccade_position_change_threshold_percent (e.g., 50 → 30)\n",
    "   → WHY: Makes it harder to classify based on post-saccade position change\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ PROBLEM: Eye position continues moving after orienting saccades (causes misclassification)\n",
    "   → SOLUTION: Increase max_intersaccade_interval_for_classification (e.g., 5.0 → 7.0 seconds)\n",
    "   → WHY: Gives more time for eye to settle, better captures true stability\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ PROBLEM: Using adaptive thresholds but getting inconsistent results\n",
    "   → SOLUTION: Set use_adaptive_thresholds = False and use fixed thresholds\n",
    "   → WHY: Fixed thresholds give more predictable, reproducible results\n",
    "\n",
    "📝 QUICK REFERENCE:\n",
    "   - bout_window: Controls how close saccades need to be to form a bout (default: 1.5s)\n",
    "   - pre_saccade_velocity_threshold: How fast eye moves before saccade = compensatory (default: 50 px/s)\n",
    "   - pre_saccade_drift_threshold: How much position changes before saccade = compensatory (default: 10 px)\n",
    "   - post_saccade_position_change_threshold_percent: % of saccade amplitude as position change threshold (default: 50%)\n",
    "   - max_intersaccade_interval_for_classification: Max time to look for next saccade (default: 5.0s)\n",
    "\n",
    "CLASSIFICATION ORDER AND LOGIC:\n",
    "================================\n",
    "\n",
    "Stage 1: Temporal Clustering (Bout Detection)\n",
    "  - Groups saccades within bout_window into bouts\n",
    "  - Saccades > bout_window apart start a new bout\n",
    "  - Result: Each saccade gets a bout_id and bout_size\n",
    "\n",
    "Stage 2: Feature Extraction\n",
    "  For each saccade:\n",
    "    a) Extract pre-saccade features (pre_saccade_window before onset):\n",
    "       - Mean absolute velocity (pre_saccade_mean_velocity)\n",
    "       - Position drift (pre_saccade_position_drift)\n",
    "    b) Extract post-saccade features (DYNAMIC window):\n",
    "       - Window extends from saccade offset until next saccade start (or max_intersaccade_interval_for_classification)\n",
    "       - Position variance (post_saccade_position_variance) - measures stability until next saccade\n",
    "       - Position change (post_saccade_position_change) - total change in position until next saccade\n",
    "       - This captures whether eye settles (orienting) or continues changing (compensatory)\n",
    "\n",
    "Stage 3: Classification (ORIGINAL SIMPLE LOGIC - Conservative Starting Point)\n",
    "  Rule 1: If in a bout (bout_size >= 2)\n",
    "    - Automatically classify as compensatory\n",
    "    - Rationale: Compensatory saccades occur in rapid succession during head rotation\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Rule 2: If isolated (bout_size == 1)\n",
    "    - If pre_vel > pre_saccade_velocity_threshold OR pre_drift > pre_saccade_drift_threshold\n",
    "      → Compensatory (evidence of drift/compensation before saccade)\n",
    "    - Else if pre_vel ≤ pre_saccade_velocity_threshold AND post_var < post_saccade_variance_threshold\n",
    "      → Orienting (stable before and stable after saccade)\n",
    "    - Else\n",
    "      → Compensatory (conservative default - when uncertain)\n",
    "\n",
    "RATIONALE FOR ORDER:\n",
    "====================\n",
    "1. Temporal clustering first: Identifies which saccades are potentially related (bouts)\n",
    "2. Feature extraction: Measures key characteristics of each saccade\n",
    "3. Classification using simple rules:\n",
    "   - Bouts: Automatically compensatory (conservative - assumes bouts indicate compensatory behavior)\n",
    "   - Isolated: Feature-based classification (pre-saccade drift + post-saccade stability)\n",
    "\n",
    "KEY INSIGHT:\n",
    "============\n",
    "- Compensatory saccades: Show DRIFT before them (slow compensation for head rotation)\n",
    "- Orienting saccades: Show STABLE periods before them (eye at rest before quick shift)\n",
    "- The pre-saccade window captures the inter-saccade interval, which is the key discriminator\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE ON CURRENT LOGIC:\n",
    "======================\n",
    "This is the original conservative starting point:\n",
    "- All saccades in bouts (>=2 saccades within bout_window) are classified as compensatory\n",
    "- Only isolated saccades are classified using features\n",
    "- This may over-classify compensatory (especially if two orienting saccades happen close together)\n",
    "- Adjust bout_window or add refinement logic if needed\n",
